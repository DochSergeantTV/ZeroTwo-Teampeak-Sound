# ZeroTwo-Teampeak-Sound
#Hey,

#I created this folder for all Zero Two fans and prepared it for Teamspeak.

#If you want to use it, just download the file and import it to: ...\AppData\Roaming\TS3Client\sound

#In Teamspeak you can now find and select the soundpack under the settings in messages

#Have a nice day: D
